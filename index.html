<h1>Console Log</h1>   
<p>To open the console log, right click and click on inspect. Then, click "console"</p>
<p>According to the website "Stack overflow", console. log specifically is a method for developers to write code to inconspicuously inform the developers what the code is doing. It can be used to alert you that there's an issue, but shouldn't take the place of an interactive debugger when it comes time to debug the code.</p>
<script>
console.log("My first Console HW");   

var first_name = "Akshat"
console.log(first_name)

var last_name = " Mishra"
console.log(last_name)

var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);

var a = 3;
console.log(a);

var b = 5;
console.log(b);

var addition = a+b;
console.log(addition);

var multiply = a*b;
console.log(multiply);

var subtract = b-a;
console.log(subtract);

var divide = b/a;
console.log(divide);
